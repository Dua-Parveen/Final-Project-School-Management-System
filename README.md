# Final-Project-School-Management-System
Overview:
This project, titled "School Management System," is my final project for the CIT  course with Python, as part of the Bano Qabil Program. The system is designed to streamline administrative tasks by managing student and teacher records, generating fee vouchers, and handling fee payments. It leverages Python and the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that is intuitive and user-friendly.
Key Features:
1.	Student and Teacher Records:
The system allows for the addition and removal of students and teachers.
It stores essential details like name, roll number, and other personal information.
	It provides options to display the records of all students and teachers, making it easier to track and manage data.
2.	Fee Voucher Generation:
	The system generates fee vouchers for students.
	It allows users to input details like student name, roll number, date, months for which fees are due, and the corresponding amounts.
	The fee voucher includes multiple months and amounts, displaying them in a neatly formatted manner.
3.	Graphical User Interface (GUI):
	The project uses Tkinter to create an interactive and visually appealing interface.
	Users can easily navigate through various options like adding/removing records, generating fee vouchers, and viewing fee payments.
